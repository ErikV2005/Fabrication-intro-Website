###Class 9: 

I made a simple Lan wifi connection to turn on and off the light

(video o it working)

but unfortinantly It wasnt working for the first couple of attempts and I was wondering why. all I changed from the original code at this point was the password and name of the wifi. It turned out that the port wasnt right and my macbook itself didnt have the basic requirments to run this somehow? so after my macbook automaticaly downloaded what it needed and correcting the port it finaly worked.

#### Unfinished changes

after making the basic version work I now tried to alter the code to turn of and on the motor. I had already finished the wiring but I had not finished the coding yet.
