###Class 4: Microcontrller and Programming

I was able to make the light turn on and blink with minimal effort. adding a button on the other hand was very frustrating becauase everything felt and was supposed to be right yet the button didnt work or I didnt notice any mistake on the wiring.

I changed the blink code to make it hold the color for a shorter amunt of thime while expanding how long the break period is. later I also altered the code that changes the rotation and speed of the motor from the sodering week of class.

but unfortinanly I couldnt set up my own motor to the board because one of the wires has broken off because of how weak it was and how I did not put hot glue on it.

overall it was a bit complicated because everything felt familiar, but sense its been a year or 2 sense I have last coded, I have forgot most of what I used to know.
