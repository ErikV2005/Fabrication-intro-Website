###Class 3: Electronics and Tools

For my motionproject I attempted to make a Hand with 2 fingers that move similar to a puppet. the strings move via the rotating motion pulling the strings thus bringing up the fingers.

tho because of me not exactly knowing the due date I had to compromise to only making one finger and no palm.

The middle part of the finger has been hard to make because of how small and how fragile that small wooden piece is. This seemingly minor inconvientence has become the bane of my very existance. I HAD TO REMAKE IT SO MANY TIMES that now I can reliably use most of the tools quickly and efficiently.

moral of the story plan stuff out way earilier in advance and make sure you CLEARLY know the deadlines and double check.
