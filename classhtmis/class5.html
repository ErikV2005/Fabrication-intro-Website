###Class 5: 3D Design and Printing

I plan on making a shape inside of a cube. I want it so I can move the shape inside of the cube so I can fidget with it when bored.

#### Prediction
My predictions from the start was that it would be to thin and flimsy because of the size im printing it at and the quality of the print and the speed. it doesnt see like it will last, at least to me.

#### Outcome
so far it is quite rigid and can stand up to falls. it seems to have turned out well with minor warping caused by the print speed and quality, but overall it seems well and most importantly fun to figet with.

to show that the shape can move here is a vide of me doing so:

I also scanned my pencle bag. the first attempt trying to do a small eraser seemed to have not worked that well so I choose to do my pencle bag because it was big enough where it was easy to scan and also not to much of a complicated scan. unfortanantly the program I was using couldnt export the model without paying so im just gonna put an image here.
