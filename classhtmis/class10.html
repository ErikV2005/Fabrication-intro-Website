###Class 7: 

I used a piezo buzzer to try to create music I have coded. unfortunantly I didnt have the time to tweak the song I was trying to make so it wasnt up to my standards.

before I tried making my custom songs I got to plays some of the other songs to test if the wiring was good. I mean the wiring was easy so I just wanted to test if it worked right.
