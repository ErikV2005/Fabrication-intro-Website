###Areas of improvment

####Code

Im no expert at coding but I know it isnt that good. it does do what its suposed to do but it is really not that efficient or well syntaxed. In my nt so expert opinion it is a mess.

####construction

The contrsuction of my project does need improvment in my opinion. cardboard is usefull but it bends more than most other materials I couls have used which did create some problems with keeping everything in place.

I could aslo use more things to keep everything in place because one of my holders for the belt isnt as tight as it was when originaly printed thus i might want to add strong glue for that
